            KNUT BROVIK.
            [Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
            laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
            much longer!
            KAIA.
            [Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
            Uncle?
            BROVIK.
            Oh, I seem to get worse every day.
            RAGNAR.
            [Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
            little sleep--
            BROVIK.
            [Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?
            KAIA.
            Then take a little walk.
            RAGNAR.
            Yes, do. I will come with you.</p>
